                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
                        physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
                        appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                        equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            
                    <p> He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
                        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
                        have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
                        repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
            
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
                        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
                        warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but 
                        would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
            
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
                        the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
            
                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
                        reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that 
                        his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
            
                    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic 
                        time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led 
                        by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                        gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being 
                        wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                        of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
                        smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and 
                        his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
            
                    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though 
                        many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
            
                    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in 
                        science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
                        the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
                        realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
            
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
                        extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
                        billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos 
                        whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
                        beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
                        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
                        water boiling over.</p>
            
                    <h1>‘As Big as It Gets’</h1>
            
                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
                        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
                        accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
                        Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                        gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
                        general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
            
                    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe 
                        expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, 
                        as big as it gets.”</p>
            
                    <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
                        sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
            
                    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath 
                        of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a 
                        picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
                        the surface of the sun.</p>
            
                    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known 
                        as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic 
                        Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the 
                        Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers 
                        submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
