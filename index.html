                <section class="newsletter-content">
                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
                        physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
                        appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                        equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            
                    <p> He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
                        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
                        have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
                        repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
            
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
                        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
                        warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but 
                        would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
            
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
                        the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
            
                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
                        reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that 
                        his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
            
                    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic 
                        time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led 
                        by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                        gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being 
                        wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                        of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
                        smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and 
                        his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
            
                    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though 
                        many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
            
                    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in 
                        science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
                        the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
                        realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
            
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
                        extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
                        billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos 
                        whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
                        beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
                        other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
                        water boiling over.</p>
            
                    <h1>‘As Big as It Gets’</h1>
            
                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
                        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle 
                        accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. 
                        Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                        gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
                        general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
            
                    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe 
                        expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, 
                        as big as it gets.”</p>
            
                    <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
                        sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
            
                    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath 
                        of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a 
                        picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
                        the surface of the sun.</p>
            
                    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known 
                        as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic 
                        Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the 
                        Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers 
                        submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10
                        million.</p>
        
                <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
                    expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
    
                <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said.
                    “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
    
                <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ 
                    worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak,
                    Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
                    with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979),
                    in his office last week.</p>
    
                <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
                    scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
                    tended his radio telescopes.</p>
    
                <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
                    most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983,
                    was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo,
                    a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA">knocked

                <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
    
                <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery
                but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually
                I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
    
                <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” 
                he said.</P>
    
                <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had
                been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of
                jubilation and caution.</p>
    
                <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if
                this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the
                history of science.”</p>
    
                <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head
                of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself 
                deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” 
                he said.</p>
    
                <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
                posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if
                true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations
                about inflation.</p>
        
                <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
                temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck
                satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
    
                <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” 
                Dr. Krauss said.</p>
    
                <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report
                its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar 
                measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
    
                <p><span>Spirals in the Sky</span></p>
    
                <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
                microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert
                Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
    
                <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. 
                He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly 
                sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates 
                ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University 
                of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and
                Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
    
                <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
                the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over
                in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                    <figcaption class="iframe-span">The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to
                        detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being
                        wrenched violently apart at its birth.</figcaption>

                <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
                polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one
                direction rather than another.</p>
    
                <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
                from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it
                in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the 
                microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky 
                should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
    
                <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small 
                differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2,
                is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
    
                <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
    
                <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
                burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right
                and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
    
                <h1>A Special Time</h1>
    
                <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
                Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected 
                was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
    
                <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long 
                suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified
                force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
    
                <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
                    grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each
                    other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting
                    away.</p>
    
                <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
    
                <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature
                falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
                freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
        
                <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state
                too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious
                latent energy.</p>
    
                <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
                antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself
                supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it
                pushed apart.</p>
    
                <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least
                a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
                to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
    
                <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles
                and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in
                today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years
                across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,”
                Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
    
                <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
                Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal.
                Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest
                of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly,
                a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
    
                <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
                asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>
    
                <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
                because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and
                randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
    
                <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian 
                astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
